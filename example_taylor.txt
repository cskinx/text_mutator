Taylor Swift sings about youth mobilization, endorses Democrats on Instagram and makes music videos with LGBTQ icons. She's complex, she's cool, she's an alpha type.
The megastar hasn't always made such explicit statements, though. Lana Wilson's new documentary, "Taylor Swift: Miss Americana," charts Swift's journey from a "careful daughter" to a more self-aware pop feminist with a lot to say -- about politics and beyond.
Indeed, the movie may be short -- 85 minutes -- but it covers meaningful territory: Swift's vulnerability ("My entire moral code, as a kid and now, is a need to be thought of as good," she admits); her eventual defiance of the same conservative mores that banished her idols, the Dixie Chicks, from the country music scene in 2003; her gradual steps toward reckoning with the at times polarizing position she occupies in, well, Americana.
